THis is proposal 2.
Strike DAO is an experiment in participatory governance of blockchain art
institutions. The Ethereum domain of Bundeskunsthalle was squatted by
artist Hito Steyerl and DoD. In the Strike DAO process we will vote on
three models of future governance of this squatted domain.

The voting will take place as a quadratic voting process in which votes
are allocated to express the degree of their preferences. Every
participant  voter is given a budget of 25 video stills that they can use
to proportionally demonstrate the voter's support. I. e. one still equals
one vote, four stills equals two votes, and nine stills equal three
votes.

Three suggestions on how to run
[Bundeskunsthalle.eth](https://bundeskunsthalle.eth) will be presented during a
live event. Participants have signed up for the process in advance and received
stills by mail as voting token. They can use them to vote either before the
event or during the event - results however will only be displayed during the
live event.
